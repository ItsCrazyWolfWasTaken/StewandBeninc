                    <h3><li>Overview of Naturalization
                    </li></h3>
                <p>Naturalization is the legal process by which a foreign citizen becomes a citizen of a country, typically involving residency requirements, application processes, and citizenship tests.
In the United States, naturalization is governed by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which outlines eligibility criteria and procedures.
The process includes submitting Form N-400, attending an interview, and passing English and civics tests.</p>

        <li>Historical context:</li>
        <p> The Naturalization Act of 1790 was the first law to establish rules for naturalization in the U.S., initially limiting citizenship to free white persons.</p>
        <li>Case Study:</li>
        <p>The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, highlighting the evolving nature of immigration policy.
Current trends show increasing scrutiny and changes in naturalization policies under different administrations.</p>
        <h3><li>Sanctuary Cities</li></h3>
        <p>Sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, aiming to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation.
The term is not legally defined, but it generally refers to policies that restrict local law enforcement from inquiring about immigration status.</p>
        <li>Historical context:</li>
        <p>The sanctuary movement began in the 1980s, providing refuge to Central American migrants fleeing violence.</p>
        <li>Case Study: </li>
        <p>San Francisco's sanctuary city policy was challenged in court, raising questions about the balance between local and federal authority.</p>
        <li>Current events:</li> 
        <p>The Trump administration attempted to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities, leading to legal battles over states' rights.
The debate continues over the effectiveness and morality of sanctuary policies in the context of national security and community safety.
