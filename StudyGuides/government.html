                <div class="dropdown-content">
                    <h3><li>Overview of Naturalization</li></h3>
                <p>Naturalization is the legal process by which a foreign citizen becomes a citizen of a country, typically involving residency requirements, application processes, and citizenship tests.
In the United States, naturalization is governed by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which outlines eligibility criteria and procedures.
The process includes submitting Form N-400, attending an interview, and passing English and civics tests.</p>

        <li>Historical context:</li>
        <p> The Naturalization Act of 1790 was the first law to establish rules for naturalization in the U.S., initially limiting citizenship to free white persons.</p>
        <li>Case Study:</li>
        <p>The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, highlighting the evolving nature of immigration policy.
Current trends show increasing scrutiny and changes in naturalization policies under different administrations.</p>
        <h3><li>Sanctuary Cities</li></h3>
        <p>Sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, aiming to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation.
The term is not legally defined, but it generally refers to policies that restrict local law enforcement from inquiring about immigration status.</p>
        <li>Historical context:</li>
        <p>The sanctuary movement began in the 1980s, providing refuge to Central American migrants fleeing violence.</p>
        <li>Case Study: </li>
        <p>San Francisco's sanctuary city policy was challenged in court, raising questions about the balance between local and federal authority.</p>
        <li>Current events:</li> 
        <p>The Trump administration attempted to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities, leading to legal battles over states' rights.
The debate continues over the effectiveness and morality of sanctuary policies in the context of national security and community safety.

        <div class="dropdown-content">
        <h3><li>War Powers Act of 1973</li></h3>
        <p>The War Powers Act was enacted to check the president's power to commit the U.S. to armed conflict without congressional consent.
It requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying military forces and limits military engagement to 60 days without congressional approval.</p>
        <li>Historical context:</li> <p>Passed in response to the Vietnam War, it aimed to prevent future presidents from unilaterally escalating military conflicts.</p>
        <li>Case Study:</li> <p>The act has been invoked in various conflicts, but its effectiveness and constitutionality have been challenged in courts.</p>
        <li>Current relevance:</li> </p>Recent military actions in Syria and Libya have raised questions about adherence to the War Powers Act.
Critics argue that the act has been largely ignored, allowing presidents to bypass congressional authority.</p>
        <h3><li>Impeachment Process</li></h3>
        <p>Impeachment is a constitutional process by which a sitting president, vice president, or other federal officials can be removed from office for 'high crimes and misdemeanors.'
The process begins in the House of Representatives, where articles of impeachment are drafted and voted on, followed by a trial in the Senate.</p>  
        <li>Historical context:</li>
        <p>Only three U.S. presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump, with none being removed from office.</p>
        <li>Case Study:</li> The impeachment of Donald Trump in 2019 and 2021 highlighted partisan divisions and the political implications of impeachment.
        <li>Current events:</li> <p>Ongoing discussions about the potential for future impeachments reflect the contentious political climate.
The role of public opinion and media coverage in shaping the impeachment process has become increasingly significant.</p>
