- Edge: Double clicking in display area appears to cause text selection (may be resolved)
- Sometimes must disconnect/reconnect gamepad to be recognized
- Hide the identifiers for the components (the names are too obvious and could be reused)
- Gamepads on iOS appears to have different control mappings (need to also test Android)
- Evaluate browser specific dependencies (key input, drag, etc.). Should these be external?
- Add options to support lower performance devices (frame skipping, disable vsync, disable sound)
- Move switches out of KB (should be input?)
- Fix top of command bar (not curved, need to fix 10px spacer above command bar)
- Fix select/reset buttons on mobile (does not stay down while pressed, 
  same issue w/ lightgun, need to use touch events)
- Local file selection button is not tabbable (it seems there is now a way to make this 
  work, and does not require javascript, need to investigate)
- Ignore text/html (drag local links into github based js7800)
- Fix bug where you can select the file chooser and cloud download, and drag the file chooser 
  (may be fixed)
- Remove certain images from pack (controller.png, etc.)
- Fix drag of logo image
- Use init in js7800 to pass common properties around (similar to REGION_NTSC, but for duplicated values).
  Using init eliminates issues with circular dependencies (values were copied previously before init existed)
- Better exception handling (for example, loading global hs, and content is bad, site is down on save and load)
- Check all XHR calls and handle exceptions appropriately
- Test changes to high score cart mid game (save at end, etc.)

- Use custom dialog instead of "input" for remote files
- Ensure images/tables/etc. Margins are the same in the documentation (they seem inconsistent)
- Table alignment throughout help seems a bit off (text is not aligned with icons, etc. in command bar help)
- Walk through all of the documentation pages and ensure styles have been properly added to css files
- Provide image sizes for help
- Add message when lightgun game is loaded (state to use mouse or touch, etc.)
- Add message when global high scores are saved successfully
- Bug if you click on select or reset and pull mouse away, does not receive button up event, keeps clicking
